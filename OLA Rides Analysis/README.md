## SQL Analysis

### Key Queries
1. Retrieve all successful bookings:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE Booking_Status = 'Success';
   ```

2. Calculate the average ride distance per vehicle type:
   ```sql
   SELECT Vehicle_Type, AVG(Ride_Distance) AS avg_distance 
   FROM bookings 
   GROUP BY Vehicle_Type;
   ```

3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_cancelled_by_customers 
   FROM bookings 
   WHERE Booking_Status = 'Cancelled by Customer';
   ```

4. List the top 5 customers with the highest number of rides:
   ```sql
   SELECT Customer_ID, COUNT(Booking_ID) AS total_rides 
   FROM bookings 
   GROUP BY Customer_ID 
   ORDER BY total_rides DESC 
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

5. Find incomplete rides and their reasons:
   ```sql
   SELECT Booking_ID, Incomplete_Rides_Reason 
   FROM bookings 
   WHERE Incomplete_Rides = 'Yes';
   ```

6. Retrieve rides where payment was made via UPI:
   ```sql
   SELECT * 
   FROM bookings 
   WHERE Payment_Method = 'UPI';
   ```

7. Calculate the total booking value for successful rides:
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(Booking_Value) AS total_successful_value 
   FROM bookings 
   WHERE Booking_Status = 'Success';
   ```
